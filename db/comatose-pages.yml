  <h2>Help Us Make the Government More Transparent</h2>
  
  
  Transparency Corps is the Sunlight Foundation's answer to the question, "How can I help?".
  
  There are many big problems that we can solve with technology, but we can't solve them all. For many of the projects that make government transparency a reality, human eyes and analysis are required. With Transparency Corps, we break those tasks down into short, small actions that make a BIG difference. Join the Corps, and let's get started!

If you complete enough, you'll get listed in our leader board below and advance to new levels. If you're really good, you could end up in our Transparency Corps Hall of Fame!
